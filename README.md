This is the much preticipated [1] prequel to not yet planned repository:  _motherfucking-bike_

[1] Yes, I know.  Preticipated isn't actually a word - despite the 5,690 results Google managed to find in 0.19 seconds.  Preticipate is a ficticious word used to denote the act of not knowing that there is something to anticipate.  Ticipate, being the antonym for anticipate, is therefore the act of no longer anticipating something.  Used in a sentence:

"I ticipated the moment they announced the iPhone 4S."
